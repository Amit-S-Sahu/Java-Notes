    "\n",
    "- Reserved words in Java.\n",
    "- We cannot use keywords as identifiers.\n",
    "- There are 50 keywords in Java.\n",
    "- They are case-sensitive.\n",
    "- Examples: `class`, `int`, `float`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `do`, `switch`, `case`, `break`, `continue`, `return`, `void`, `static`, `public`, `private`, `protected`, `final`, `abstract`, `synchronized`, `volatile`, `transient`, `native`, `strictfp`, `throws`, `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`, `extends`, `implements`, `interface`, `package`, `import`, `this`, `super`, `new`, `instanceof`, `true`, `false`, `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name given to a class, method, variable, etc.\n",
    "- It is case-sensitive.\n",
    "- It should start with a letter, currency character, or underscore.\n",
    "- It can contain letters, currency characters, underscores, and digits.\n",
    "- It should not be a keyword.\n",
    "- It should not contain spaces.\n",
    "- It should not start with a digit.\n",
    "- Examples: `Name`, `name`, `Name123`, `name_123`, `name$123`, `$name`.\n",

    "\n",
    "-  A literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code.\n",
    "- Constants in Java.\n",
    "- Literals are used to initialize variables and constants.\n",
    "- Literals are represented directly in the code without requiring computation.\n",
    "- There are 5 types of literals in Java:\n",
    "  - Integer Literals: `10`, `20`, `30`, `10_000`, `20_000`, `30_000`\n",
    "  - Floating Point Literals: `10.5f`, `20.5f`, `30.5f`, `10.5`, `20_000.5`, `30_000.5`\n",
    "  - Character Literals: `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'` , `'\\u0000'`, `'\\u0001'`, `'\\u0002'`, `65`, `66`, `67`\n",
    "  - String Literals: `\"Supragya\"`, `\"Gandotra\"`, `\"Java\"`\n",
    "  - Boolean Literals: `true`, `false`, `True`, `False`\n",
    "  - Null Literals: `null`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prefix 0 is used to represent octal literals.\n",

    "#### Escape Sequence\n",
    "- An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that does not represent itself when used inside a character or string literal, but is translated into another character or a sequence of characters that may be difficult or impossible to represent directly.\n",
    "- Escape sequences are typically used to specify actions such as carriage returns and tab movements on terminals and printers.\n",
    "- The backslash `\\` is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character.\n",
    "- The following escape sequences are available in Java:\n",
    "  - `\\\\` - backslash\n",
    "  - `\\'` - single quote\n",
    "  - `\\\"` - double quote\n",
    "  - `\\n` - newline\n",
    "  - `\\r` - carriage return\n",
    "  - `\\t` - tab\n",
    "  - `\\b` - backspace\n",
    "  - `\\f` - form feed - new page\n",
    "  - `\\uXXXX` - Unicode character\n",
    "  - `\\0` - null character\n",
    "  - `\\s` - space\n",
    "  - `\\ddd` - octal character (ddd)\n",
    "  - `\\uxxxx` - hexadecimal Unicode character (xxxx)\n",
    "\n",
    "  ``` java\n",
    "  public class escape{\n",

    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comments are used to document the code and improve its readability.\n",
    "- Comments are ignored by the compiler and are not included in the executable code.\n",
    "- There are 3 types of comments in Java:\n",
    "  - Single Line Comment: `//`\n",
    "  - Multi Line Comment: `/* */`\n",
    "  - Documentation Comment: `/** */`\n",

    "### Separators in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separators are essential in Java to distinguish different parts of the program. They serve various purposes and include the following characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `;` - **Semicolon**: Used to terminate statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `,` - **Comma**: Separates consecutive identifiers in variable declarations and is also used to separate parameters in method definitions and invocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `.` - **Period**: Separates consecutive identifiers in variable declarations and is used to chain statements in the test expression of a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `()` - **Parentheses**: Used to contain a list of parameters in method definitions and invocations. Also used for defining precedence in expressions, control statements, and surrounding cast types.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `{}` - **Curly Braces**: Used to define a block of code, for classes, methods, and local scopes. Also used to contain the value of automatically initialized arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `[]` - **Square Brackets**: Declares array types and is used when dereferencing array values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `:` - **Colon**: Used after labels in switch statements and in the conditional operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `::` - **Double Colon**: Used in method references.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `...` - **Ellipsis**: Used in variable argument lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `<>` - **Angle Brackets**: Used in generics to specify type parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `?` - **Question Mark**: Used in the conditional operator.\n",
