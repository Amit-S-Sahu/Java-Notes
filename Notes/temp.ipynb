    "- Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The following control flow statements are available in Java:\n",
    "  - Conditional statements: `if`, `else`, `switch`, `case`, `default`\n",
    "  - Looping statements: `while`, `do`, `for`, `break`, `continue`\n",
    "  - Branching statements: `return`\n",
    "  - The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.\n",
    "  - The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if the same condition is false.\n",
    "  - The `switch` statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed.\n",
    "  - The `while` statement is used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "  - The `do` statement is used to execute a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly execute the block as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "  - ternary operator \n",

    "  - The `for` statement is used to execute a block of code a specified number of times.\n",
    "  - The `break` statement is used to terminate the loop or switch statement.\n",
    "  - The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration.\n",
    "  - The `return` statement is used to exit from a method, with or without a value.\n",
